# To-Do-App-1.1
Early doors basic to do app
This is me working in the basics of just getting an app up and running. So far I've made a db connection and got the basic thing running, but you can't add anything to it quite yet and it looks like shit. About 3/5th of the way through version #1.

So far I have 

Initialised Node
Install of required Node modules
+Path
+Express
+Express-layout
+Mysql
+Router
+Body-parser
+EJS

setup server.js (this is the node run page)
routes.js (all the apps get their shizzle from the db here)
setup layouts.ejs - using ejs for our to do form
setup index.ejs, header.ejs, footer.ejs - you know what this does: using JQuery ansd Bootstrap in the header.
setup the function components of the app
 +components/todo_table
 +components/add_todo
 setup database using terminal - CREATE SCHEMA `todo`
 setup database table using terminal - CREATE table `todo` - id (pk), todo, listname, complete, timestamp
 setup javascript file 
 
 TO DO 
 
 Sort out the CSS files. SO far only using a little bootstrap.
 setup routes.js to get the data
 setup routes.js to add the actual to do items
